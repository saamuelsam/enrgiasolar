                {
                    q: "How does photovoltaic solar energy work?",
                    a: "Solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy through photovoltaic cells. The generated energy is sent to an inverter that transforms it into alternating current, compatible with your electrical network. The surplus can be injected into the utility grid, generating energy credits."
                },
                {
                    q: "How long does installation take?",
                    a: "The complete process from technical visit to installation takes an average of 30 to 60 days. The physical installation of the panels is quick, usually 1 to 3 days, depending on the system size. The longer time is due to approval procedures with the utility company."
                },
                {
                    q: "Is financing available?",
                    a: "Yes! We work with various financing lines up to 120 months. We offer partnerships with banks and financial institutions that have special conditions for solar energy. In many cases, the financing installment is less than the savings on the electricity bill."
                },
                {
                    q: "What is the equipment warranty?",
                    a: "Solar panels have a 25-year warranty for minimum 80% efficiency. Inverters have a 5 to 10-year warranty (extendable). Additionally, we offer installation warranty and technical support throughout the period."
                },
                {
                    q: "Do I need maintenance?",
                    a: "Maintenance is minimal. We recommend cleaning the panels every 6 months (or when necessary) and annual system inspection. In Fortaleza, rain already helps with natural cleaning. We offer preventive maintenance plans to ensure maximum efficiency."
                },
                {
                    q: "How long to recover the investment?",
                    a: "Return on investment (ROI) varies from 3 to 7 years, depending on consumption and system size. Considering that panels last over 25 years, you'll have at least 18 years of practically free energy after recovering the investment."
                },
                {
                    q: "Does it work on cloudy or rainy days?",
                    a: "Yes! Even on cloudy days the panels generate energy, although in smaller quantities. The system is sized considering the region's climate variations. Additionally, credits generated on sunny days compensate for periods of lower generation."
                },
                {
                    q: "Can I install in an apartment?",
                    a: "Yes, it's possible! For apartments, there are two options: installation on the building's roof (with condominium approval) or participation in solar farms (shared generation). Our team evaluates the best solution for each case."
